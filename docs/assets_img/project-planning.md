## **Definition Statement** ##

<p>I would like to build an application that will assist martial arts trainers and students alike.  This application will track the students progress towards each “belt” level and provide a physical training plan for each student to fill in and track their progress towards the next goal.  Each Sensei will have the ability to see each students training (outside of the dojo) and provide feedback that assists the student in progressing.</p>


### **What problem does this app solve** ###

<p>Currently, many dojos do not have or provide a way for each student to plan and track their own progress and training (physical and technique) towards the next Belt.  Nor do most dojos have a means (other than verbal) to provide feedback to each student.</p>

### **How I will incorporate end user/customer in the dev process** ###

<p>The end user for this application will be 1. Sensei’s, 2. Students, 3. Parents.  To incorporate each of these users, I will implement a series of meetings to discuss the needs of the dojo, the needs of the student, and the capabilities of the parents.  As well as meetings to discuss functionality, and intuitive design. These will likely be weekly meetings with follow-up emails and phone calls.</p>

### **Why is it important to incorporate the user/customer** ###

<p>The user is the entity with the “problem” or with the most buy-in for a solution.  The user will be the one either using the application or deciding not to use the application.  If the user does not take an active part in the development process, then it is unlikely we will design an application that the user will use/buy.  We will not have provided a proper solution/option for the customer, and they will likely do business with a different company.</p>

### **Technique for obtaining feedback** ###

<p>Interview with customer, survey, and polls</p>

### **Define audience** ###

<p>The audience for this application will be Elite Freestyle Karate</P>

### Research ###

1. **Nike Run Club App**
  * Positive features are the fact that it is a club of like-minded runners all linked together to share routes, pace, distance.
  * A negative aspect is that it only tracks running activities, not all exercises, not form, or technique.
2. **Garmin Connect App**
  * Positive features include an abundance of data.  This app tracks steps, heart rate, intensity/minutes, stress, weight, calories, and much more.
  * A Negative feature is that it tracks everything without any input or requirements from the user.  It is also a distance-based app, it does not help with form or technique.
3. **Fight Athletic Training App**
  * Positive features are the number of training options, videos, and advice.
  * The negative is that it is all app based, with no place for training logs, or an in-person coach/trainer to provide feedback.
4. **Determination**
  * All in all, my app will provide a venue for students and sensei to set goals, monitor progress, provide feedback (from instructors), and manage all requirements for testing for the next belt level.

### SWOT ###

1.  **Strengths**
  * Allows students to take responsibility for their own progress.
  * Captures all requirements to progress to next level.
  * Enables Sensei’s to provide written feedback to each student.
  * Enables Sensei’s to see students “out-of-class” efforts and provide guidance
2. **Weaknesses**
  * Requires students to input data.
  * Will require adult supervision to keep students honest.
3. **Opportunities**
  * Potential to expand to other dojo’s.
  * Enables Sensei’s top teach responsibility.
  * Potentially motivate students to work harder (and smarter).
4. **Threats**
  * Analog tracking (the current way) has been “working”.
  * Competition from other tracking apps.
  * Requires both students and Sensei’s to input info and adopt a new way of doing business.
